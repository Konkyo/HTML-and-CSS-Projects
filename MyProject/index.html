					     <h2>What is World of Warcraft?</h2>
						 <p>World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Blizzard Entertainment. It was first released in 2004 and quickly became one of the most popular and
						    influential video games of all time.<br>
							<br>
							In WoW, players create a character and enter a virtual world populated by other players and computer-controlled characters. They complete quests, explore the world, and engage in combat with monsters
							and other players. As they progress, they earn experience points that allow them to level up and become more powerful.<br>
                             <br>
							WoW has a rich and complex lore that draws from various fantasy and science fiction sources. Players can choose from a variety of races and classes, each with their own unique abilities and 
							playstyles. The game also features extensive social and economic systems, such as player-run guilds and a virtual economy based on in-game currency.<br>
                             <br>
                            Over the years, WoW has undergone many updates and expansions, adding new content and features to the game. It remains one of the most popular and enduring MMORPGs to this day, with millions of 
							active players around the world.

					<h3>List of classic raids</h3>
					
					<details>
					   <summary>Zul'Gurub</summary>
					   <p>Zul'Gurub is a 20-man raid located in the northeastern portion of Stranglethorn Vale, east of Lake Nazferiti. Tier Set Gear does not drop in Zul'Gurub, however there are class-specific armor sets 
					      available that all contain five pieces of epic quality gear. All of these set pieces are available through quest rewards and reputation requirements with Zandalar Tribe. The set pieces themselves are 
						  not from boss drops inside Zul'Gurub.<br>
						  <br>
						  Hundreds of years ago, Zul'Gurub served as the capital city for the Gurubashi Troll Tribe, however, it was eventually destroyed by civil war and corruption from within. Centuries later, Atal'ai Priests
						  have reclaimed the city for their own evil deeds, with the intention to summon their Blood God, Hakkar, who is the final boss of Zul'Gurub.
						 </p>
				    </details>
					
				     <details>
					    <summary>Blackwing Lair</summary>
						<p>Blackwing Lair can be found at the very height of Blackrock Spire and is a 40-man raid instance. It is there in the dark recesses of the mountain's peak that Nefarian has begun to unfold the final 
						   stages of his plan to destroy Ragnaros once and for all and lead his army to undisputed supremacy over all the races of Azeroth. To this end, he has recently begun efforts to bolster his forces, much
						   as his father Deathwing had attempted to do in ages past.<br>
						   <br>
						   <em>In the dark recesses of the mountain's peak, Nefarian, the eldest son of Deathwing, conducts some of his most awful experimentation, controlling mighty beings like puppets and combining the eggs of 
						   different dragonflights with horrific results. Should he prove successful, even darker pursuits rest on the horizon.<br>
						   <br>
                           And, yet, the Lord of Blackrock is not a mere scientist - he is a great dragon cornered in his lair. Can he truly be defeated by mortal hands?
	                       </em></p>
                     </details>			

                     <details>
                         <summary>Molten Core</summary>	
                         <p>The Molten Core is located beyond Blackrock Depths in the deepest part of Blackrock Mountain. It is the home of Ragnaros the Firelord--one of the four elemental lieutenants of the Old Gods--and his
						 elemental minions. Molten Core is a 40-man raid instance.<br>
						 <br>
						 <em>The Molten Core lies at the very bottom of Blackrock Depths. It is the heart of Blackrock Mountain and the exact spot where, long ago in a desperate bid to turn the tide of the dwarven civil war, 
						 Emperor Thaurissan summoned the elemental Firelord, Ragnaros, into the world. Though the firelord is incapable of straying far from the blazing Core, it is believed that his elemental minions command 
						 the Dark Iron dwarves, who are in the midst of creating armies out of living stone. The burning lake where Ragnaros lies sleeping acts as a rift connecting to the plane of fire, allowing the malicious 
						 elementals to pass through. Chief among Ragnaros' agents is Majordomo Executus - for this cunning elemental is the only one capable of calling the Firelord from his slumber.
						 </em>
						 </p>
					 </details>
					 
					 <details>
					    <summary>Naxxramas</summary>
						<p>Naxxramas is a giant necropolis floating over Stratholme, in Eastern Plaguelands. It has the honor to serve as the seat of one of the Lich King's most powerful officers, the dreaded lich Kel'Thuzad.<br>
						<br>
						The instance consists of four different wings which, when cleared, grant access to the Frostwyrm Lair (a fifth and final wing). The first four wings are, in order of ascending difficulty: Spider, 
						Plague, Deathknight & Abomination. Progression is non-linear - raids may select their own path to the final lair.<br>
						<br>
						<em>An ancient Nerubian ziggurat, Naxxramas was torn free from the ground by agents of the Lich King to serve as Kel'Thuzad's base of operations as he spreads the plague throughout Lordaeron.<br>
						<br>
						Due to Kel'Thuzad fighting a war against the Scarlet Crusade, the Argent Dawn, the Forsaken and the humans of the Alliance, as well as constant incursions of adventurers from every race and nation into 
						the Scourge-controlled Plaguelands on a daily basis, his forces have been severely taxed to maintain the security of his necropolis. But now that the gates of Naxxramas are open, Kel'Thuzad's new forces 
						are rapidly sweeping away all opposition to the Scourge.</em>
						</p>

					<details>
					      <summary>Ahn'Qiraj</summary>
						  <p>Ahn'Qiraj, simply known by most as AQ40, is a 40-man raid located in southern Silithus, with the entrance in the same general area as its 20-man counterpart: Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj. The raid itself was 
						     not made available until a server-wide event, Ahn'Qiraj War Effort, was complete, culminating in the opening of the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj, by having at least one player ring the Scarab Gong to trigger
							 the event and receive  Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal. For Classic WoW, AQ40 will be available starting Phase 5.
